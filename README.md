  - Begin the creation of the memory game

### EXPECTED:
  - The user will enter the game screen, see the account creation part and the game modes. Depending on the, the application will behave differently. The logic is the same: if the cards are mismatched, they turn face down again, if matched, a point is added and the cards are no longer acessible.
    ‚ùóThis doesen't apply to the "If you miss, you lose" mode, where the game ends if the player makes a mistake. 

Main - Learn and understand the logic of the entire application
